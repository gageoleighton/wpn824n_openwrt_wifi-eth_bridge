# wpn824n_openwrt_wifi-eth_bridge
I could not use opkg to install packages so I made my own flash images to include relayd for configuring a wifi to ethernet bridge.

Router info:

Flash and finish setup using the following website instructions:

Build guide:

FYI: This was built on a raspberry pi 3 and took about 10 hours to build
